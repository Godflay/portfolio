I will always be grateful for the opportunity PTW gave me. I started as a game tester and they gave me a chance in IT. This allowed me to learn and grow not only in IT, but as a person too.
# Experience Nov 2020 - May 2021
Started off as an LQA game tester. In this role I learned the very basics of game development and my passion for video games only grew stronger.
# Experience May 2021 - May 2022
I eventually took a chance and applied for the junior IT admin position and got it. I learned so much in this year alone. However, what I liked, were games. The experience here was undoubtebly important for my career development.
