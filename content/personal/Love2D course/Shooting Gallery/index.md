# Ludum dare 55 (hosted by BHVR)
This game was created in 48 hours in Godot during the ludum dare 55 hosted by BHVR. I worked on this game with other colleagues, however, unfinished, it was a great learning experience for all of us. This was, for the most part, our first time creating a full game in Godot. I personally worked on the drag and drop + snap to schedule logic, this unfortunately took most of our time and we didn't have the chance to finish the game, but we're glad with what we accomplished and what we learned in those 48 hours!
