# Dev notes
Slow progress this week, but progress is progress!<br/>
## New changes
-Improved opening cutscene, the subway is now moving with SFX.<br/>
-Changed the Menus a bit to fix a translation issue, see "Bugfix"<br/>
-Removed pages, added cassets and computer instead for lore.<br/>
-The ops room isn't empty anymore.<br/>
## Bugfix
-Fixed misaligned texts in the Menu caused by translation.<br/>
-Fixed an issue where picking up the flashlight would cause the game to crash.<br/>
## Known issues
-Some texts in-game might be misaligned, mistranslated or not translated at all. The feature is new and will be improved. Localization is hard m'kay!<br/>
-Settings menu from the Main menu is working! However, only the bug report feature and the language settings are setup so far.<br/>
-Settings from the Pause menu is currently broken, and you will have to restart the game.<br/>
-The ops room is missing its ceiling.<br/>
-Ticket gates can be walked through, they don't have a collision box yet.</br>
## Upcoming features
-Settings menu will be fully implemented very soon.<br/>
-Pause menu will be reworked, only resume and back are working as of now.<br/>
-Keep working on the story.<br/>
-Add more events.<br/>
-More to come! (I want to keep the scope rather small, it's easier to add stuff that way)</br>
