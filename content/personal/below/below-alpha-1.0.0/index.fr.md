# Dev notes
I thought I would make a page to have some sort of "patch notes" to show progress of the game.
## Known issues
-Settings menu is not working right now, see "Upcoming features"<br/>
-Options/Settings button not working in the Pause menu, see "Upcoming features"</br>
-The ops room is empty and missing its ceiling, will rework that room.<br/>
-Paper pages for the lore are just random textures to test the feature for now, see "Upcoming features"<br/>
## Upcoming features
-Settings menu will be implemented very soon.<br/>
-Pause menu is somewhat working, however, some buttons, like options aren't fully implemented yet.<br/>
-Keep working on the story.<br/>
-Will add text to the paper pages.</br>
-Translation<br/>
-Add more events.<br/>
-Will reduce the "grain" of the PSX/VHS shader, some testers have reported it was somewhat difficult seeing stuff.</br>
-More to come! (I want to keep the scope rather small, it's easier to add stuff that way)</br>
