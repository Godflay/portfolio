# Godot game
First 3D game made in Godot as a solo dev.<br/> 
Below is a horror game that takes place in a metro station. You're on your way for an evening out with friends when you notice the metro is down. Discover the metro station and get the metro running again while something dark and sinister lurks in the shadows.<br/>
