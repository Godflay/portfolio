# Dev notes
Some exciting new changes coming along! I've been working on not very important stuff if I do say so myself:v<br/>
## New changes
-Added localization support for English, French, German, Spanish and Russian! Languages can be changed from Main Menu > Settings > Languages<br/>
-Added a bug report feature! Can be found in the Settings menu<br/>
## Bugfix
-Fixed a lot of issues with collisions where the player could fall off the map or walk through walls.<br/>
-Added text to let the player know the door is locked, players have reported it was not obvious the door was locked.<br/>
-Slightly reduced the "grain" of the shader, some players have reported it was somewhat difficult to see in-game.<br/>
## Known issues
-Some texts might be misaligned, mistranslated or not translated at all. The feature is new and will be improved. Localization is hard m'kay!<br/>
-Settings menu from the Main menu is working! However, only the bug report feature and the language settings are setup so far.<br/>
-Settings from the Pause menu is currently broken, and you will have to restart the game.<br/>
-The ops room is empty and missing its ceiling, will rework that room.<br/>
-Paper pages for the lore are just random textures to test the feature for now, see "Upcoming features"<br/>
-Ticket gates can be walked through, they don't have a collision box yet.</br>
## Upcoming features
-Settings menu will be fully implemented very soon.<br/>
-Pause menu will be reworked, only resume and back are working as of now.<br/>
-Keep working on the story.<br/>
-Will add text to the paper pages.</br>
-Add more events.<br/>
-More to come! (I want to keep the scope rather small, it's easier to add stuff that way)</br>
